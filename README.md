# SQL_Oracle_21c
I developed knowledge of object-relational database management system software, relational database design including
normalization, design implementation in an enterprise class dbms and writing SQL queries. I installed Oracle, then created users,
assigned basic privileges, created tables, inserted data, specified indexes and wrote basic to intermediate SQL queries. The queries
involving inner and outer joins, aggregation, materialized views, Top-n results, subqueries, correlated subqueries, rollups, cubes, set
operations. Transaction control commands and triggers were also introduced.
I used Data Modeler to develop logical and relational schemas and DDL in an Oracle 21c environment. 
I also used SQL Developer to querying the database and writing scrips.
During my study I developed strong interest in Analytic solution development.
